## About Us

We're a 500+ member strong community full of some amazing people who love San Diego.

Sandiego.js was started by Patrick Crowley and Kevin Ball in 2011 and has grown at a
fast pace since its inception. [3rdSpace][] has been a gracious host for the entire time and
we've had secondary meetups at OneHealth in Solana Beach and Qualcomm offices in Sorrento Valley.

## The team

The core organizers of the group are Kevin Ball, Patrick Crowley, Jarrod Overson, and Jason Strimpel, with help from many others.
If anyone is interested in helping out in any regard, please let us know via a [github issue][issues], email,
or by poking us on the shoulder at any meetup.
