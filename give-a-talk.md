If you have something JavaScript related to share with your peers that you could say/show in less than 5 minutes, **we want to hear you give a talk**!

Have you been learning JavaScript and want to spend a couple minutes sharing something you learned? Did you find a library or discover a JS feature you'd like to share? Have an interesting method for learning or teaching JavaScript? Want to share something you made? Want to show off a niche feature of one of your favorite libraries?

We also have a wiki page with [talk ideas][1] that you can use for inspiration.

#### Submitting your talk

Once you are ready to submit a talk please email your talk subject to the [SDJS organizers](mailto:sandiegojs-organizers@googlegroups.com).

#### Preparing for your talk

You will be presenting on a `800x600px` projector so make sure to tailor your slides to that dimension. We try to livestream every presentation so practice slow and clear speaking.

__Do's:__

- Use a large legible font
- Use white slides with black text
- Practice your talk at home and time it

__Don'ts:__

- Use more than a few slides. *We'd recommend 6*
- Live code/demo for your first talk. It's really hard for a lighning talk.
