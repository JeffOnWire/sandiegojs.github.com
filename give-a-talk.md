If you have something JavaScript-related to share with your peers that you could say/show in less than 5 minutes, **we want to hear you give a talk**!

Have you been learning JavaScript and want to spend a couple minutes sharing something you learned? Did you find a library or discover a JS feature you'd like to share? Have an interesting method for learning or teaching JavaScript? Want to share something you made? Want to show off a niche feature of one of your favorite libraries?

We also have a wiki page with [talk ideas][1] that you can use for inspiration.


#### Submitting your talk

Once you are ready to submit a talk please email your talk subject to the [SDJS organizers](mailto:sandiegojs-organizers@googlegroups.com).

#### Preparing for Your Talk

You will be presenting on a `600px` width projector so make sure to tailor your slides to that dimension. Using a large font with white text on a black background will make your content more legible.

Want to chat about your talk while you prepare it?  Join the [chat room][2]!


### Suggest a presentation topic

Have an idea you'd like to hear someone give a talk about?  We have a wiki page with [talk ideas][1] you can clone and add your ideas to it! Alternatively you can post suggestions to any of the [chat rooms][2].
