### IRC Web Client

If you haven't used IRC before, the fastest way to start is by using the web client. You don't need to install anything on your computer for this.

You'll need to choose a unique username and then you'll be put in the #sandiegojs channel on Freenode. You can type by clicking in the text box at the bottom and using your keyboard.

Visit the Web Client: [https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sandiegojs](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sandiegojs)
