Join us Tuesday February 10th at a **new** location in the UTC area for a look at dependency injection.

### Inside The Matrix - Dependency Injection for Mere Mortals by Todd Bashor

Dependency injection is one of those mysterious concepts you have heard of but may not feel like you have a complete handle on. In this presentation, we'll clarify what DI is and give you a practical and powerful way of implementing it using architect.js. Learn how to make your code cleaner, easier to test, and generally more awesome.

### Location Details

We'll meet at 7:00 at ServiceNow, [4810 Eastgate Mall, San Diego, CA][map]. After the talk we'll head to Draft Republic for drinks, food, and conversation.
