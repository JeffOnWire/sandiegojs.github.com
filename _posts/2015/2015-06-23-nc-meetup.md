{% include JB/setup %}

Join us Tuesday June 23 in North County for two very different talks about style.

### Styling React Components
Michael Chan will teach us about styling React components. React allows you to write styles inline and bypass a host of CSS shortcomings. Scope, dependency management, dead code elimination, these problems go away when adding your styles directly to components. But it's not all rainbows and unicorns. Things like theming and media queries become much more difficult when styles live directly on components. In this talk, we'll look at how to solve these problems with contexts and plain old JavaScript. We'll also look at the role of container-components and when it's better to "just use CSS.‚Äù 

### Automating JS Style Conventions
Scott Mathson will teach us how to use tools like jshint, jscs, istanbul, plato and gulp to automate and enforce your project's JavaScript style conventions.

### Location Details

We'll meet at 7:00 at WalmartLabs, [1530 Faraday Ave Carlsbad, CA][map]. After the talk we'll head to Pizza Port Bressi Ranch for drinks, food, and conversation.
