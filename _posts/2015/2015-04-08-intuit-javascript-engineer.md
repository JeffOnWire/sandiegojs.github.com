### Great Opportunity - From an Engineer's Perspective

Hi everyone,

I'm going to the dark side and switching from engineering to product management.

I'm leaving a great role with an amazing team, and am trying to backfill my position so I don't leave them in the lurch so to speak.

It is a full time engineering role at Intuit working on Live Community, a question and answer community similar to Quora.

[Intuit Live Community](https://ttlc.intuit.com "TurboTax Live Community")

We operate on huge scale, supporting all Intuit products, with a fleet of 100 app servers on AWS.  Needless to say there are plenty of incredibly fun problems to solve.

Its a fun role where you can work on all parts of the app, from front to back end. The app was rewritten two years ago and is a pleasure to work on, Rails 4 with HAML, SCSS, Bootstrap, Angular/Backbone (separate parts of app) and tons of great back end action as well. Charts, queues, worker processes, and we use just about every AWS service in some shape or form.

Besides that, its the best company I've ever worked for, incredible campus and even better benefits.

We are looking for somebody to take the lead on our JavaScript implementation. They will have huge freedom to pick the technologies they feel fit best and make architectural decisions.

If you have any interest or questions, please reach out to me at the email below. I can also forward along your information with a recommendation :)

Cheers,

- Ben
