Join us Tuesday May 26 in North County for an introduction to the Ionic Framework.

### Intro to the Ionic Framework
Chris Griffith will introduce you to the Ionic framework. What is the Ionic Framework? The Ionic Framework combines Google's AngularJS with Apache's Cordova to create fast and beautiful cross-platform mobile apps for iOS and Android. In this talk we will explore Ionic, show how to install it, and finally build a quick and dirty app and deploy it to both iOS and Android.
