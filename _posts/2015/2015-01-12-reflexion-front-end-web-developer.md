title : Front End Web Developer - Reflexion Health

### Who is Reflexion Health?

We are a small, world class team looking to transform healthcare. Together, we are creating exceptional, engaging medical software that helps healthcare professionals do their jobs better and lets us all fall in love with our own healthcare all over again (…or, maybe, just for the first time).

Just because healthcare is serious business doesn’t mean we can’t have a little fun. And along the way, how about we aim higher? Let’s make healthcare cheaper, better, and more personalized. Why should we expect any less?

We need bold. We want to re-imagine what medical software can be, and how technology can help expert clinicians work with patients to make us all healthier, happier, and richer (since we’ll be saving so much dough on our healthcare).

If you’re up for the challenge, come join us. Transformation won’t be for the faint of heart; you should be ready for Reflexion Health to be the primary focus of your life. We will be working together, eating together, and playing together. So you will need to be here in San Diego (or willing to move), and have the desire to leave the practice of medicine nothing like way you found it.

### Reasons To Join

* Be part of the West Health family– a truly inspirational set of organizations that are moving mountains to lower healthcare costs for all Americans
