Join us Tuesday January 27 in North County for a look inside AngularJS.

### Inside Angular: How this painkiller works by Kai Chen

Angular takes away a lot of the pain in javascript web development.  In this presentation we take a brief and partial tour of Angular's source code, as well as some parts of Angular-UI, to study how this is achieved. Many angular concepts, such as DI, services, directives, scope, data and event binding, become lucid when you look at how it's implemented.  And finally we look at a real-life example of using Protractor, Angular's end-to-end testing harness, to alleviate the most painful component in web development.

### Location Details

We'll meet at 7:00 at WalmartLabs, [1530 Faraday Ave Carlsbad, CA][map]. After the talk we'll head to Pizza Port Bressi Ranch for drinks, food, and conversation.
