Share your knowledge and experience with sandiego.js! We know some of you would like to present but hesitate to do so for various reasons. For that reason, we are offering a workshop that will help you:
	- Pick a topic to present
	- Structure the presentation
	- Make it interesting
	- Make it concise

This workshop will be interactive. Organizers will give short presentations followed by facilitated small group activities aimed at building the outline for some talks. You could walk away with a huge jumpstart for a talk.

So if you want to increase your awesomeness and contribute to our thriving community of javascripters, join us for this rare opportunity.

### Location Details

We'll meet at 7:00 on the second floor at EvoNexus, [101 W Broadway suite #200](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/101+W+Broadway+%23200,+San+Diego,+CA+92101/@32.7150983,-117.164295,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80d954a84a1fe9a1:0x37a8c0521720bfd?hl=en). Park in the garage below the building and we'll have validation tickets up at the meetup.
After the talks we'll head to a local bar or restaurant for some drinks and chat.
