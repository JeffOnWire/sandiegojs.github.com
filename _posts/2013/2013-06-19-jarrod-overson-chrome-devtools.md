If you want to learn about everything you're not taking advantage as a web developer then join us at [1 American Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d4065!2d-117.168994!3d32.71589!4m25!2m11!1m10!1s0x0%3A0x75cc1806e65569a6!3m8!1m3!1d425343!2d-112.125051!3d33.6054149!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5m12!1m11!1s1+american+plaza+san+diego!4m8!1m3!1d425343!2d-112.125051!3d33.6054149!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1) on
 Tuesday, July 2nd at 7:30pm. Jarrod Overson will do his best Paul Irish impersonation, 
 waxing giddy about DevTools and showing everything from interactive debugging, to source maps, to JavaScript profiling.
 
We will also have a few more copies of Aaron Frost's [JS.next: A Managerâ€™s Guide](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001623/index.html) to give away so come early and tell us how desperately your company needs this book in order to snag one.
