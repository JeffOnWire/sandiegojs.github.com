This month's meetup will forego its normal format in favor of a nice, chill evening at [Stone Brewing in Liberty Station](http://www.stoneworldbistro.com/home.asp).

This is an informal event starting at 7:30 and can run as long as the restaurant is open. There is no reservation and is first come, first served. It's a large area, but if you want to play bocce, get there early!
