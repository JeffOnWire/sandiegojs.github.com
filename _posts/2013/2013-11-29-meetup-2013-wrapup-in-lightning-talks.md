This month we'll be heading back down to [One America Plaza][venue] in downtown San Diego for a bunch of Lightning Talks.

In no particular order, and subject to change, we have:

- Using JavaScript for 3d games with Unity (John Cozen)
- Building and deploying JavaScript with Grunt (Scott Mathson)
- Overview of SASS, the CSS preprocessor (Dan Robert)
- Common Development SEO Mistakes (Josh Ansell-McKinnon)

We will be meeting at 7:30 at [One America Plaza][venue] and will probably be around there for about an hour to an hour and a half.
After the meetup we will venture out for drinks and chat to one of the nearby bars or restaurants.

Parking is validated to midnight at the garage underneath the [venue][], just make sure to pick up a ticket at the meetup.
