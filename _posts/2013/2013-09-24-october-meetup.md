Check us out as we venture into North County to have our first meetup at one of our sponsors, WalmartLabs!

Tonight's deathmatch pits two popular javascript frameworks in a fight for your affection.
Which framework is best when faced with requirements for well-structured code, data binding, view handling, and testability?

Todd Bashor of Starter's Academy will be going over the basics of Backbone and Angular so that you can make
educated decisions on your next projects.

We'll be meeting at 7:30 at [WalmartLabs in Carlsbad, 1530 Faraday Avenue, 92008](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=1530+Faraday+Avenue%2C+Carlsbad%2C+CA+92008&data=!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x80dc730becd4b1c3%3A0xca8b8266862afb53!3m8!1m3!1d429156!2d-117.1089785!3d32.8245525!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1).
There is parking on either side of the building.

Afterward we generally head out to a nearby bar or restaurant and, given the new venue, we're taking suggestions as to the
best spots in the area!
