### Welcome to the new [sandiego.js][] website!

We're proudly hosted entirely
on [Github](http://github.com) so you can [view the source](https://github.com/sandiegojs/sandiegojs.github.com/) and contribute via the same routes you are already familiar with.

We welcome any pull requests from the community for everything from typos to design changes to blog posts (yes, even blog posts as
pull requests). We're using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to manage the site and [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
for the design.

If you want to get in touch with us for site problems, suggestions, meetup ideas, or anything related to
the [sandiego.js][] community, please use the [sandiego.js issue tracker](https://github.com/sandiegojs/sandiegojs.github.com/issues)
to open and track feedback.

Thanks and welcome!
