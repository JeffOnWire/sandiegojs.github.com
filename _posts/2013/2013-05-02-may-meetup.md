{% include JB/setup %}

Join us on Tuesday to see Dexter Pratt go over his usage of three.js to power
his network visualization tool [triptychjs](http://www.triptychjs.com/). [Three.js](http://threejs.org/) is a 3d
graphics library that powers the majority of cutting edge 3d visualizations in JavaScript.

Max Nanis will also give a talk on his usage of [D3](http://d3js.org) to visualize biological
data at the Scripps Research Institute. D3.js is a library for creating data-driven visualizations in HTML and standard
technologies.

### About Dexter Pratt

Dexter Pratt is currently directing the NDEx project (Network Data Exchange) at UCSD / the Cytoscape Consortium.
NDEx will be a public website and open-source code base to enable the sharing, publication, and manipulation of biological network data.
In the last decade, He's worked in systems biology, developing knowledge networks representing biological cause and effect
and algorithms that use those networks to interpret large-scale experiments. He was the originator of BEL,
the Biological Expression Language (see www.openbel.org).

### About Max Nanis

[Max Nanis](http://maxnanis.com/) is a computational biologist with the Su Lab and freelance software engineer.
A founding partner and lead developer overseeing software development at The Pacific Social Architecting Corporation,
he builds and automates digital personas to act and behave on human networks. At The Scripps Research Institute
in La Jolla, CA, he builds biological games, robots, and data visualizations focused on helping to understand
genomic and proteomic data. Previously at the Molecular Graphics Lab and the RCSB Protein Data Bank, his
research focuses on molecular dynamic simulations and macromolecular visualization of protein-ligand complexes.
When not in the lab, he's using Fortran to build sculptures of genetic and proteomic forms.
