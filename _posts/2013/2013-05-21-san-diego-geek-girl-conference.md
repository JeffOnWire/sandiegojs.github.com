<strong>The Bad News:</strong> It is no secret that there is a shortage of women in technology. Anyone who has attended the
San Diego JavaScript meet up or any other technology event can attest to this fact.

There are myriad of groups for women in technology. These organizations are great, but they are targeted at
women who already have a strong background in technology. What about those who are wanting to take that first step?

<strong>The Good News:</strong> Enter [Geek Girl](http://geekgirlcamp.com/). Geek Girl was founded by
[Leslie Fishlock](https://twitter.com/LeslieFishlock) in order to help  women of all ages take that first step by
creating an environment in which it is acceptable to ask “silly questions” about all aspects of technology.

Great! How can I help? I am glad you asked...

<strong>Take Action:</strong> Geek Girl is holding a [conference](http://sandiego.geekgirltechcon.com/) right here in the world’s
classiest city, San Diego, on June 29, 2013. And guess what San Diego JS has a 20% off promo code just for you,
[SDJS13](http://sandiego.geekgirltechcon.com/)!

Please forward this posting, volunteer at the event, encourage others to volunteer, and most importantly register and attend workshops!

See you there. -Jason
