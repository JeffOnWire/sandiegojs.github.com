Windows 8 provides the single largest money making opportunity that has ever been available to individual developers.
Not only that, but it has the widest array of programming languages with which native applications can be developed.
In this session, we will cover the basics of the Windows 8 operating system and how HTML5/JS/CSS developers can
leverage their existing skills to create first class applications that run on Windows 8 RT.  In addition, we will
take a quick look at a few of the tools that are available for building games on Windows 8.  I Hope to see you there!
