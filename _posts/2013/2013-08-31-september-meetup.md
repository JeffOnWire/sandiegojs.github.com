Join us Tuesday Sept 3rd for two awesome speakers we're happy to have back at sandiego.js.

Developer Evangelist Bret Stateham will talk about deploying node.js
applications on Azure and Brackets core developer Jason San Jose will 
go through one of the coolest new technologies being talked about, debugging JavaScript
without breakpoints with Brackets and Theseus.

As usual we'll meet at 7:30 on the second floor of [One America Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=one+america+plaza&data=!1m4!1m3!1d3405!2d-117.1687419!3d32.7164008!4m11!1m10!4m8!1m3!1d429156!2d-117.1089785!3d32.8245525!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1). Park in the garage below the building
and we'll have validation tickets up at the meetup. After the talks we'll head to a local bar or restaurant 
for some drinks and chat.
