jQuery is coming to town, [jQuery Conference, San Diego](http://events.jquery.org/2014/san-diego/). Don't
worry there are not any lists and doesn't matter if you have been naughty or nice. Although you should probably
just be nice because no one likes a jerk. Anyway...

The conference is in February but the Call For Papers ends November 10th. This is an amazing opportunity to share your JavaScript and jQuery knowledge without having to travel to some
ridiculously cold location like Boston or San Francisco.

However, before you can kick some knowledge and represent San Diego you have to submit a proposal to speak.
If you have never submitted a proposal before, don't worry, San Diego JavaScript has you covered.
There will be a working session at WalmartLabs where those who are interested in submitting a proposal
can get the low down from Adam Sontag ([@ajpiano](https://twitter.com/ajpiano)) via Skype. After the call there
will be the opportunity to pitch ideas and work on your proposal with the help of others.

Despite the name, jQCon is *not* strictly about jQuery, it has expanded to all things frontend in the world of JavaScript.
Be creative and confident and pitch some ideas. There will be lots of great advice and you may even find a new topic
that you didn't think of before.

If you just want some feedback on your proposal or want to help others, great. All are welcome.

Adam will be joining us via Skype at 7:30, so be sure to get to [WalmartLabs in Carlsbad, 1530 Faraday Avenue, 92008](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=1530+Faraday+Avenue%2C+Carlsbad%2C+CA+92008&data=!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x80dc730becd4b1c3%3A0xca8b8266862afb53!3m8!1m3!1d429156!2d-117.1089785!3d32.8245525!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1) earlier.
