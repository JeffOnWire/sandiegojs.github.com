jQuery is coming to town, [jQuery Conference, San Diego](http://events.jquery.org/2014/san-diego/). Don't
worry there are not any lists and doesn't matter if you have been naughty or nice. Although you should probably
just be nice because no one likes a jerk. Anyway...

This is an amazing opportunity to share your JavaScript and jQuery knowledge without having to travel to some ridiculously
cold location like Boston; sorry [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com/) Boston is great, but it gets too cold for us Southern Californians.

However, before you can kick some knowledge and represent San Diego you have to submit a proposal to speak.
If you have never submitted a proposal before don't worry San Diego JavaScript has you covered. There will be a working session at WalmartLabs where those who are interested in submitting a proposal can get the low down from Adam Sontag via Skype. After that there
will be the opportunity to pitch ideas and work on your proposal with the help of others.

If you just want some feedback on your proposal or want to help others great. All are welcome.

We'll be meeting at 7:30 at [WalmartLabs in Carlsbad, 1530 Faraday Avenue, 92008](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=1530+Faraday+Avenue%2C+Carlsbad%2C+CA+92008&data=!4m12!2m11!1m10!1s0x80dc730becd4b1c3%3A0xca8b8266862afb53!3m8!1m3!1d429156!2d-117.1089785!3d32.8245525!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1).

There is parking on either side of the building.
