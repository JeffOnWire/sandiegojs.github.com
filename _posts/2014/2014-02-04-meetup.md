Join us Tuesday February 4th for two awesome speakers.

### Unit Testing a Client-server AMD Code Base by Jason Strimpel
Unit testing is never easy, but it is a necessary evil in software development. Unit testing an AMD code base is even more difficult. A few questions that quickly arise are â€“ How do I mock dependencies? How do I ensure my paths have been configured? How do I generate coverage reports? This talk will answer all these questions and much more.

### Fun with Speech by Jon Dimm
Create hands-free interfaces using new HTML5 speech API's. We will look inside two examples. TalkShow is an exercise in ambient computing, using the Web Speech API and Named Entity Recognition -- it eavesdrops on your conversations and shows images of things you mention. The Translating Telephone is a web app for multilingual conference calls, combining the Web Speech API and Web Real Time Communicaton (WebRTC) with text-to-speech and online translation services.

We'll meet at 7:30 on the second floor at EvoNexus, [101 W Broadway suite #200](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/101+W+Broadway+%23200,+San+Diego,+CA+92101/@32.7150983,-117.164295,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80d954a84a1fe9a1:0x37a8c0521720bfd?hl=en). Park in the garage below the building
and we'll have validation tickets up at the meetup. After the talks we'll head to a local bar or restaurant
for some drinks and chat.
