Hello all! My name is Dan Robert and I'm really excited to get involved with the San Digeo JS meetup as a co-organizer. I've been attending the meetup for quite some time now and presented a lightning talk back in December on Sass. This is a great community here - I am thrilled to see it grow and continue to meet awesome new people!

#### A little about me:

I am a front-end web developer with a background in psychology/sociology and web design. Originally from the suburbs of Detroit, MI, I have been living out here in San Diego for about 7 years. When I am not working on something design or dev-related, I enjoy reading on the topic, traveling, playing outside (surfing, snowboarding, hiking, etc) and hanging out with my wife and our dog, Tucker.
