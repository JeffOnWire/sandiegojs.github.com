Join us Wednesday May 21 at 7:30 for a special visit from Brian Cardarella.

Learn how to build and TDD a simple app with ember-cli. Brian will go over es6 modules, the Broccoli build system, the ember-cli conventions, and live-code an application.


We'll meet at 7:30 on the second floor at EvoNexus, [101 W Broadway suite #200](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/101+W+Broadway+%23200,+San+Diego,+CA+92101/@32.7150983,-117.164295,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80d954a84a1fe9a1:0x37a8c0521720bfd?hl=en). Park in the garage below the building
and we'll have validation tickets up at the meetup. After the talks we'll head to a local bar or restaurant
for some drinks and chat.

#### About Brian Cardarella

At age 12, Brian began coding and, by age 14, he had one of his games featured in Newsweek magazine. Since then, heâ€™s had papers published on large integer mathematics and has spent years learning and honing his talent. He is fluent in C/C++, Assembler (MASM), and TCL. But for the last several years, he's been a dedicated Rubyist. His portfolio of work spans enterprise business, a top start-up and an international political organization. Brian built The Boston Ruby Group to one of the largest in the world and is active in the software community at large.

Depending on the season he can be found either on a sail boat or a snowboard in his down time.
