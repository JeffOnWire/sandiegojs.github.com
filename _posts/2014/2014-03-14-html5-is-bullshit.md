I *love* the web in very dirty ways but there are so many misconceptions as to what the web is and what it
can do right now that I feel like the community needs to admit something before it can effectively communicate
with people who don't associate themselves with development on the web platform.

#### ***HTML5 is absolute bullshit***

The term HTML5, not any underlying technology. The term is bullshit.

The term HTML5 was adopted quickly by non-technical people and has become the spiritual successor to "Web 2.0."
It's marketing bullshit. Stop using it. It has virtually no relevance to many of the technologies it refers to
now and only serves to confuse people when you try to involve web technology in discussions.

One of the biggest problems with "HTML5" is that it means many different things to different people. To technical people
outside of the web, it's a flash in the pan that won't amount to anything substantial (hint: it's not). To product management,
it's a cheap alternative to native UI that has a rich developer pool to choose from (hint: it's not cheap and the developer pool
 is huge but very shallow). To everyone else, HTML5 just looks like web pages or flashy demos.

The web platform is an evolving toolset that can enable creative solutions with *unique value*.
It doesn't replace native, it's not cheap and easy, and it needs to be described appropriately so that
we can enable people to make educated and informed decisions.

This was spurred by a trip to [O'Reilly's Fluent Conference](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/) which was an excellent
conference filled with brilliant people talking about amazing technology. It was just loaded with
"HTML5." On books, on speaker tracks, in titles, in descriptions, in talks themselves.

HTML5, technically, does exist and does refer to something specific, but even technology leaders use the overloaded
term in the marketing sense, not the technical sense. It's not useful for the community to continue its use because
it poorly manages expectations of audiences.

If you need to refer to the broad capabilities of the web nowadays, use "The Web Platform" or "Web Technology".

It's not trivial pedantry. It's UX. Right now "HTML5" provides a poor user experience to people looking inside the
bubble of JavaScript and Web Engineering and it provides no actual benefit aside from selling books and getting people to
click on ads and links to blogs.

That's why you're here, after all.
