Come check us out at EvoNexus downtown where we'll be trying a new format where we'll take
some of the benefit of typical unconferences and apply them to San Diego JavaScript.

## What is an UnMeetup?

Hell if we know! What we do know is that, while presentations and lightning talks are awesome,
they require a lot of prep and can be an unpleasant sounding commitment. We'll be approaching the
night with a blank slate and, when we get together, we'll ask for people to write on note cards
what they're interested in talking about and what they're interested in hearing about.

After quick votes we'll decide where the night leads.

Comment here to get some ideas started beforehand.

As usual, we'll meet at 7:30 on the second floor at EvoNexus, [101 W Broadway suite #200](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/101+W+Broadway+%23200,+San+Diego,+CA+92101/@32.7150983,-117.164295,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80d954a84a1fe9a1:0x37a8c0521720bfd?hl=en). 
Park in the garage below the building and we'll have validation tickets up at the meetup. 
After the meetup we'll head to a local bar or restaurantfor some drinks and chat.

See you there!
