Join us Tuesday September 2 for an introduction to Knockout.js!

### Knockout.js by Cody Jenkins

In this talk we will explore Knockout.js: the light-weight library that packs a punch! Originally developed by Steve Sanderson of Microsoft, Knockout.js is a JavaScript implementation of the MVVM pattern. It allows developers to create responsive interfaces with minimal code and maximal maintainability. Cody will demonstrate basic Knockout usage in the context of a simple web application.

Cody Jenkins is a software artisan with 8 years of full-stack development experience. He works with medical device manufacturer ResMed in Kerny Mesa developing management software to help doctors treat patients with sleep apnea.
