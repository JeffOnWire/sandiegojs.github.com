One of the first meetups I joined was San Diego Node.js. I anxiously waited for the next meeting, but alas, it never came. So I was stoked when I heard the Node.js meetup was merging with SanDiego.js and they were looking for an organizer. I've been looking to get more involved with the group, and this was a perfect opportunity to contribute to an under-served portion of the javascript community.

## Who Am I

Some of you may have met me at the monthly meetings or hack nights. I even gave a couple of talks in <a href="https://github.com/thestartersacademy/headless-surfing">2012</a> and <a href="http://sandiegojs.org/2013/meetups/2013/09/24/october-meetup/">2013</a>. I took a little hiatus from the group for the past year (new baby, new job, you know the story), but I'm back. 

In addition to my day job and raising my three kids, I'm a web development coach at <a href="http://thestartersacademy.com">The Starter's Academy</a>. I've been in the software industry a long time in a variety of jobs and in every one of them I've been working with javascript. I love it.  

## Community

So, whether you are new to Node.js or a pro, now is a great time to get more involved in the community. Please let me know if you want to speak at a meeting or want to hear about something in particular. 

Be sure to check out our <a href="http://sandiegojs.org/2014/meetups/2014/08/05/meetup/">next meeting</a> about Express 4.
