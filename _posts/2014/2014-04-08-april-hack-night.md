Join us for our April Hack Night at [3rdSpace](http://3rdspace.co/) where we relax, ask questions and drink beer.

### What is a Hack Night?

Hack Night is a casual meetup of the SanDiego.js collective where members are encouraged to work together on problems or projects, ask questions, pair up and generally just relax.

[3rdSpace](http://3rdspace.co/) does us the honor of hosting us on the third Tuesday of every month for this event. They have a rad pad full of couches, stools, lofted ceilings, and a full kitchen.

Beer and snacks will be provided (feel free to bring your own), but YOU provide the awesome atmosphere, questions, and your unique skillsets!

### Where?

As usual, we'll meet at 7:30 in the room across from the kitchen right when you walk up the main stairs and onto the second floor of [3rdSpace](http://3rdspace.co/), [4610 Park Blvd](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3rdspace/@32.761228,-117.146367,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfdc1619caf7b6a70?hl=en-US).

See you there!
