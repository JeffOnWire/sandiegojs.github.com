Join us Tuesday June 6th for two awesome speakers

### Deal With It by Xavier Lange

Let's create a rich, standalone webapp for annotating images with sassy sunglasses. This talk will cover how to load an image in to the DOM, animate sunglasses over the image, and maybe, just maybe generate a redistributable GIF. How fun!

### About Xavier Lange

Xavier is a San Diego hacker focused on the whole stack. Creating cross platform UIs has pulled him in to JavaScript and he's having a good time.

### Fake It Til' You Make It by Heather Brysiewicz

Pretender is a mock server microlibrary that can be used to ignite development. We will review a sample application using Pretender and talk about how to begin your own project, as well as what to do when you are ready to transition to a real server.

### About Heather Brysiewicz

Heather is a beach bum with a coding addiction. As a recent transplant she and her dog, Squirt, are taking San Diego by storm.

### Location Details

We'll meet at 7:30 on the second floor at EvoNexus, [101 W Broadway suite #200](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/101+W+Broadway+%23200,+San+Diego,+CA+92101/@32.7150983,-117.164295,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80d954a84a1fe9a1:0x37a8c0521720bfd?hl=en). Park in the garage below the building

for some drinks and chat.
