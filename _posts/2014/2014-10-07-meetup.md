Join us Tuesday October 7th for an awesome speaker

### Famo.us by Andrew Reedy

Famo.us is a free, open source JavaScript framework that helps you create smooth, complex UIs for any screen. Famo.us is a great replacement for HTML5 / DOM interactions in the browser. Andrew will give an overview of the basics of Famo.us and how his team uses it to achieve native feeling transitions and interactions in cross-platform mobile applications using purely Javascript. With the recent announcement of an additional 25 million in funding and the partnerships with companies like Intel, Facebook, Mozilla, Apache, Venture Beat, Famo.us will be a very important technology to know in the next few years.
