### Programming with Functions by Jesse Williamson

Functional programming is everywhere, and while there may be debate over whether JavaScript could be considered a functional language, it does have one big thing going for it: first-class functions. Functions allow for a great deal of flexibility in our code, but coding in a more functional style requires a new way of approaching problems. In this talk, we’ll go back to basics of what a function is math, in computer programming and in JavaScript specifically. We’ll look at the power of composition to make larger programs out of little generic pieces. We’ll look at higher-order functions and finally combinators that allow use to augment our functions with new behavior to create new functions.

### Location Details

We'll meet at 7:00 at WalmartLabs, [1530 Faraday Ave Carlsbad, CA][map]. After the talk we'll head to Pizza Port Bressi Ranch for drinks, food, and conversation.
