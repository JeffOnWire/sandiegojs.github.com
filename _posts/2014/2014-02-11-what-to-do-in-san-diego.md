Hi San Diego visitors,

If you're in town for Roost or jqcon you're probably staying near the convention center, or "Hotel Circle."
This is a popular spot for conventions but leaves you with little to do if you don't have a car.

Directly north of the convention center is [Fashion Valley](http://www.simon.com/mall/fashion-valley) which has a Trolley
Station ([map](http://www.sdmts.com/Trolley/documents/TrolleyMap.pdf)) that you can use to get to central parts of San Diego.

### Looking for Mexican Food?
Try taking the trolley to the Old Town station to visit [Old Town, San Diego](http://www.oldtownsandiegoguide.com/)([map](http://www.oldtownsandiegoguide.com/2012/home/2012map_viewweb.pdf)).
This is a good tourist area with loads of food and walkable attractions.

### Looking for good food and drink?
Head to the Little Italy station and make your way to India Street to visit the heart of [Little Italy](http://www.littleitalysd.com/).
You'll find great food, good bars, and excellent desserts.

### Looking for night life?
Try heading downtown to the Gaslamp district. Take the trolley down to Santa Fe depot, walk east on Broadway until you get to
4th street, and head south. You'll find plenty of great restaurants, bars, clubs, and shops.

### Have a car?
If you're travelling by car or have the time to explore some of the further stops by bus, try getting out to some of the beaches!
Ocean Beach, Mission Beach, and Pacific beach are good, reliable stops for great views and enough life to occupy you once
you realize it still actually gets cold in San Diego.

Heading over to North Park, Hillcrest, and South park will get you some of the best breweries and brewpubs in the region.
Toronado, Hamiltons, Blind Lady, Tiger Tiger!, and the South Park Abbey just to name a few.

Have fun and reach out to the San Diego locals for more advice!
