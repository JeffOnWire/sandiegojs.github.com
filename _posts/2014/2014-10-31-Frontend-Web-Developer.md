## Exceptional Front-end Web Developer - Ceresti Health

### A Noble Cause

Be a part of something big! Ceresti is pioneering a new standard of care for Alzheimer’s Disease and other dementias. 5.7 million families in the US are taking care of a loved one with Alzheimer’s in the home.  The estimated annual cost of dementia care exceeds $200 billion and is projected to increase six-fold to $1.2 trillion by 2050. FDA approved drugs are only marginally beneficial, and there is no cure in sight.  The burden on caregivers is devastating.  

We aim to change that. By combining experts in dementia with cloud-based technologies and some things we’ve learned along the way we want to change the lives of these families for the better.


### About You

We are a startup.  You will be one of the early employees.  As such we are looking for an exceptional front-end developer.  You need to live and breathe web technologies - HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript and most of all AngularJS.  We think Angular is awesome.  You will be part of a small development team where every member is a key individual and where everything you build will matter to the success of the company and to the future of many families.  

The culture is highly collaborative and creative.  We want the best ideas from everyone.  We expect you to embrace good development habits - thoughtful designs, careful test cases and effective build and deployment practices.  We expect you to be transparent, courageous and enthusiastic.  Have a great idea?  Tell us about it - we want to learn - and be open to suggestions - so you can learn.
