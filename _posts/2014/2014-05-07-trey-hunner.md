{% include JB/setup %}

My name is Trey and I'm excited to announce that I plan to help co-organize the San Diego JS meetups.  I have attended San Diego JS meetups for many months and I gave a presentation on EditorConfig [last year][1].

#### Who I am

I am a full-stack web developer and a San Diego native.  I love hacking on open source and helping out prospective web developers.  I have been making cool web stuff for fun and profit for over a decade.

#### Community

I organize the San Diego Hacker News meetups and I co-organize the San Diego Python meetups.  I also irregularly organize San Diego Open Source meetups.  I am also a serial contributor to open source projects.
