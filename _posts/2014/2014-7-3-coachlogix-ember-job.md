Are you a rock star JavaScript developer with Ember.js experience looking for a chance to help lead development of an enterprise-grade web platform as part of a small, high-energy startup team?


### WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO FITS THE FOLLOWING PROFILE:

* Has 5+ years of professional experience building JavaScript and jQuery-heavy, production-grade web applications-- particularly ones that leverage RESTful APIs
* Uses Git on a regular basis
* Is comfortable building and working with Handlebars templates
* Is ready to dive into building and maintaining a large-scale, single-page Ember.js web application (or is ready to quickly learn)
* Huge Bonus: someone who already has some hands-on experience building Ember.js applications, even as a hobby

*This is a PERMANENT, FULL-TIME role. No contractors please*


### WHO WE ARE:

We are CoachLogix: a San Diego-based startup getting ready to launch an exciting cloud-based platform for a very underserved professional market.  The product is 95% of the way there but we need a couple more driven individuals to get us past the finish line.

A few highlights of what we have to offer:

* Competitive Salary and Stock Options package
* Privately-funded team with more than enough runway to reach profitability
* Office in the heart of the Gaslamp Quarter downtown
* Free parking
* Open, bright start-up office environment with whiteboard walls and large windows overlooking downtown
* Unlimited coffee and tea
* A high degree of autonomy and flexibility to help us build the best product we can
* An opportunity to make your mark on a product that is already being demoed before several fortune 100 companies
* A chance to be one of the first 10 employees of a company poised to see explosive growth in the year ahead

### Interested? We want to hear from you!
