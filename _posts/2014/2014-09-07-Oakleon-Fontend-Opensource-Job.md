title : Fulltime or contract, open source project at Oakleon
---

### Oakleon
Oakleon is an early stage startup based in San Diego. We are building an adaptable data platform for real-time business operations.

### The Job
 Build a front-end for our data platform. The current iteration is based on react.js (from facebook) as we like building software in a functional style and react makes that easy. Components will include mapping, charting, scheduling and dynamic form generation. The goal is a declarative system that adapts to the data it is asked to represent. This project will be open sourced during development. You should have some understanding of what it takes to make hybrid applications perform well on mobile devices.

### Some Perks
Flexible work schedule, remote working options, a health care plan that works for you, and untracked vacation.

### Apply
Send a CV, background description, or something more creative to [Tim Cash](mailto:tim@oakleon.com). Include links to a github, linkedin, stackoverflow profile etc... Be prepared for a live coding session and lengthy discussion about the most challenging problems you have solved.
