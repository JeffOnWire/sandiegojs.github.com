Join us for our Monthly Hack Nights at [Fanpics](http://fanpics.com/) where we relax, ask questions, drink beer, eat pizza and hang out.

### What is a Hack Night?

Hack Night is a casual meetup of the SanDiego.js collective where members are encouraged to work together on problems or projects, ask questions, pair up and generally just relax.

[Fanpics](http://fanpics.com/) does us the honor of hosting us on the third Tuesday of every month for this event. They have a rad pad full of couches, stools, lofted ceilings, and a full kitchen. They have an open area where members are encouraged to mingle and relax and chat and a quieter loft area for those with a desire to hack away.

Beer and pizza will be provided (feel free to bring your own), but YOU provide the awesome atmosphere, questions, and your unique skillsets!

### Where?

We meet at 7:00 inside the old Mission Brewery buiding. The main entrance is on the corner of Hancock and Washington. Signs will be posted so you know where to go from the front door to the Fanpics pad, [2150 Washington Street](https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ll=32.741707,-117.183648&z=15&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&q=2150+Washington+St+San+Diego,+CA+92110).


### PARKING!

The area is ripe with street parking, especially in the evening when people have left the neighboring office buildings. Here is a map with ideal street parking highlighted.
